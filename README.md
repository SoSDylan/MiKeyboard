# MiKeyboard
A user interface and controller for custom lighting for Corsair RGB keyboards.

## Using MiKeyboard
To start using MiKeyboard [download](https://github.com/SoSDylan/MiKeyboard/raw/master/Output/MiKeyboardSetup.exe) and install it on your computer. Install effects into the `Effects` folder in the directory that MiKeyboard.exe is located.

## Developing for MiKeyboard
*TODO*

MiKeyboard uses [CUE.NET](https://github.com/DarthAffe/CUE.NET) to handle all of the lighting updates for the Corsair Keyboards. An example project for a lighting effect is located under the [Rainbow Effect](https://github.com/SoSDylan/MiKeyboard/tree/master/RainbowEffect) subfolder.

Build the `.dll` file, place it in your effects folder and restart MiKeyboard to use the effect.
